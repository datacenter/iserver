how to show/use sessions apps
bgp view?
bfd session timers follow policy... how to get the policy name?
when showing instances, indicate the node role and maybe version as there are bfd deps
c-bit awareness
resolve ip to names (?)
interface context
ease of going from vlan intf to phy interface(s)
where bfd is configured
